            <h2>Antonio Neil</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I have recently completed my 1st intership at CXC as a Software Developer and I am now in my
                final year at the University of the West Indies. I am required but would also love to get an Internship for my Spring Semester and Summer Semester
                so that I may have roughly a year of experience and also practining my Leet Code to be Job Ready. Carrer goals aside, I am 6'3", I love gaming,
                anime, swimming and going to the gym. My life's purpose is simple to be successful. Successful to me means I have enough money so that I can
                move my mother out of her house, retire her and me and wife and kids can live a comfortable life. I am interested in INFO2180 because 
                in my expereince in the field and in projects that I have worked on while attending University I have used html css javascript Vue and Nodejs
                and even some SQL so I would like to formally learn more about web development so I can create some personal projects while doing so and build a portfolio.
